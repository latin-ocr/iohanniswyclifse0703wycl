2 g· 4. The Society‘s Boolts sor 1888, 1889, ancl 1890.

by Mr. M. H. Dziewioki, now printing at Fromme’s,
Vienna, two sheets up, the whole copy side-noted.

De Dominio Dii-ino, edited by Dr. Reginald Lane Poole‚
lately ro-collated by him in the Vienna University
Library, with a long Appendix of the first four Books
of the De Pauperie Salvam-is of Richard F itz-Ralph,
Archbishop of Armagh, to whose doctrine of Dominion,
Wyclifowed much. This work is printing at the Claren-
don Press, Oxford, and five sheets of it are in type.

3. That one of the two last-named books which last leaves
the press will be the first volume of the Society's issue for
1889. The second will be, Vol. IV. of Wyclif’s Sermons,
edited by Prof. Loserth. It will include all those Sermons
that are still in MS. only. Five sheets of this work are 111
type. The Committee trust that both these volumes will be
out during the present year.

4. For 1890, Prof. Loserth will, with his unfailing and
steady help to the Society, produce one volume, either of the
Opus Eranqelaum or the De Eaclzarz'sz‘z’a. Of Dr. Herzberg-
Frankel’s edition of Dc Simonia, Book X. of the Samma, the
whole is in type, tho without sidenotes. Dr. Rudolph Beer
has copied from the unique MSS. the 13 Qaaestiones Loyz'cae
et Philosophiam, and the De Eate particulari, and they are
now at Fromme’s press in Vienna. Mr. Dziewicki has
in hand Shirley's copy of the Lopsica, and will send it to
press with the Losyz'eae Ooim‘naaz‘e'o soon after the transcript
of the latter (lately orderd) has been made. Mr. Dziewicki
may also be able to prepare for the printer this year, De
Blaspleemz'a, Book XII. of the Samma, the editing of which
Mr. Τ. A. Archer has been obliged by ill-health to give up.

Thus, either by the close of 1889, or during 1890, at least
four of the books named in this Section 4, ought to be ready.
If they are, the Committee will not put off the issue of them,
but will send out two for 1890 and two for 1891, asking
Members for Aac-(mee Sahserz'pfz'ons for one of these years. It
willbe a proud day for the Wyclif Society‚ which has been
for eight years in annual arrear with its work, if it can,
for a happy change, be a year in advance. Those Members
who care enough for Wyolif to pay their advance subscrip-
tion will get their books in advance; those who don't, will
get their volumes (if they pay promptly) in the first week
of J anuary in the year the books are assignd to, instead of
waiting for them, as heretofore, till the March or June of
the year following. They will thus benefit by the generosity
