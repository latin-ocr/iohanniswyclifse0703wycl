INTRODUCTION.

1. The Contents.

The great importance which we attributed to the second volume
of the Sermons extends to those contained in the third.

Both are chiefly occupied with combating the abuses of the
Church and the usurpations of the hierarchy, especially of the Papae)-
and the Friars, Which, as Wyclif insists‚ have no foundation in Holy
Scripture; and with the emphatic demand that the prosperity of the
Church may be restored by a return to the state of the apostolic age.

A considerable part of the Sermons is directed against the
decrees of the Earthquake Council (May 1382).

Questions concerning the government of the Church are more
fully expounded than those of a dogmatic nature. Yet these are not
altogether omitted, and a considerable space is allotted to dealing
With priesthood, baptism, confirmation, confession and the Eucharist.

Thus the present volume forms a supplement in the full sense
of the word to the second volume, and all which has been said of
that applies also to this.

This consideration makes it unnecessary to supply any summary
of the contents of these sermons,
