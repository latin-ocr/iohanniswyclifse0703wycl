single MS„ the Codex Ρ). 16, 2 of Trinity College Library, Cam-
bridge (described in Sermons vol. l, page XXXV); all the more that
this MS. abounds in faults and omissions.

The faults are so numerous and of such a nature, that one must
doubt, whether the scribe understood Latin. Yet the faults which
spring from his misunderstanding and careless writing (few of which
can be corrected vvith absolute certainty) impair the value of the
MS. less than his numerous omissions.

Single words, parts of sentences, and probably even long pas-
sages are missing. In consequence of these omissions the text in many
places gives no sense, and correction is rendered more difficult by the
impossibility of deciding whether the omissions are of single words or
of sentences,

How faulty the text of A is, can be seen from the few ser-
mons preserved in a second MS. this is:

b) The Codex C. ι, 23 of Trinity College‚ Dublin described by
Mr. F. D. Matthew in the preface to De Ecclesia (pp. XXII and XXHl).

This codex contains only four sermons of the third part, viz.
5, 6, 7 and 10.

Mr. J. H. Bullock‚ who has collated these sermonS‚ does not
agree with Mr. Matthew about the date, which he puts not at about
1400, but at a later period.

c) De Religione Privata II. As the treatise verbally agrees with
the second part of the 29⁸¹ Sermon (page 230),

“Circa hanc epistolam dubitatur, utrum privata religio sit datum
optimum . . . Explicit pag. 239. Et patet falsitas assumptorum domini
in suis arguciis et quomodo vendicat mendacia in suis descripcionibus
et racionibus quare ordines sint privati''‚ we here enumerate the MSS,
containing this treatise namely the MS. 3930 and 4527 of the Vienna
Imperial Library and Χ. Ε. 9 of the University Library at Prague.
