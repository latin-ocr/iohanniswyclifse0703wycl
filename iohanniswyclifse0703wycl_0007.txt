of the Advance—Subscribers. If only the Society could, on
this plan, get its remaining eight years' work done in four,
the gain to all concernd would be great.

5. The volume in arrear for 1887, De Officio Reffl's, edited
by Mr. A. W. Pollard‚ M.A.‚ and Mr. Oharles Sayle, B.A.‚
is still, the Committee regret to say, unfinisht. But all its
text and Indices are printed, and the Introduction is in type.
It needs only 3 description of the MSS.

6. Through the Rev. Dr. Buddensieg, the Rev. H.
Schnabel of Dresden has kindly undertaken to edit a volume
of Mc'seellaneous Troadises by Wyelif, out of those mentioned
011 p. 4. Mr. M. H. Dziewicki has also agreed to edit other
Texts for the Society besides those which he has now 111
hand.

Mr. F. D. Matthew 1133 again been obliged to give all the
time that 113 can spare the Society, to writing the side-notes
to Prof. Loserth's volume, reading Dr. Poole's and Mr.
Dziewicki's, and making suggestions with regard to them.
He has been obliged to stop night-work at his own editions
of Wyclif’s Miscellaneous Tracts and De Mcmdaz‘c's, so that
the appearance of these must be deferd till more leisure and
stronger health come to him.

Dr. Buddensieg has done about 3 quarter of his edition of
the De Veriz‘ate, but having accepted 3 call to the Head
Mastership of a Public High School in Dresden, his new duties
will compel him to set aside his Wyclif work for at least two or
three years. Besides the remaining volume of Sermons, Prof.
Loserth has kindly undertaken to edit Wyclif’s De Euclea-
re‘stz'a tractatus mesor (Shirley, No. 18), and he has also copied,
and will edit, the Opus Ecanqelz‘enm, sice De Sermone Domini
inMom‘e (Shirley, No. 42). M. Patera is proceeding slowly
with his edition of De Potestate. Mr. Hessels has laid aside
his imperfect copy of De Actibus Animae.
