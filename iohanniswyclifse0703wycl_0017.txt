INTRODUCTION. V

previous volumes. The numerous gaps in the text due to the bad MS.
are marked in the foot-notes, as far as they could be discerned.

Ι have to express my most sincere thanks to those gentlemen
who have kindly assisted me in my work.

My thanks are due to the founder of our Society‚ the Hon.
Director‚ Dr. F. J. Furniva113 to Mr. Bullock for revision of the MS. A.
and for collating the Dublin Codex3 to Dr. R. Buddensieg for
proof-reading‚ and above all to Mr. F. D. Matthew‚ who not only
wrote the side-notes, but also put at the editor's disposal valuable
suggestions, both critical and explanatory.

As the editor had to read a great part of the proofs during
his stay at Karkhad, where no library for references was at his dis-
posal‚ he must claim the reader's indulgence for some slight errors
which escaped his notice.

Czernowitz, 28t¹¹ November 1888.
