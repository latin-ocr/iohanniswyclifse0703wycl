Reasonable folk will see at once that with this great outlay on
copying—an outlay without which the Society could not have
moved a step—large issues of books have been impossible.
Moreover, Members must remember that over AEl-fiO worth
of work done for them has been pam, not by them, but by the
Bishops’ Fund(<;8100), and by the other donations to the Society
which have amounted to ζ11362 143. Τ116 Committee cannot make
bricks without straw. The Society's 1331163 depend solely on
the amount its Members subscribe3 and if any Member com-
plains of the smallness of the issues, he should feel bound in
conscience to accompany his complaint with a <1650 note in
order that his grievance may be remedied. The Society has
a big job in hand, the payment of England's debt to its great
early Reformer's memory, the printing of all the Latin
works he has left, in which the record and development of
his ideas are to be traced. Many years of strenuous effort
are needed for this task‚ both on the part of Members in
general and the Society's Editors in particular. Much copying
of MSS. has still to be done. New Editors for some of
the Treatises already copied, and for those still untoucht, are
wanted. The preparation of a Wyelif MS. for press is no
easy matter, as Dr. Poole explaind in the Report for 18843
it often takes years of the scanty leisure which an Editor
can spare from the other engrossing work of his life. Mean-
time the duty of subscribing Members is clear: to provide
the money wanted for copying and printing ; to pay their
own Subscriptions promptly, and 10 canvas all their friends
and acquaintances for more.

Society's Editors, Copiers‚ and Helpers, and specially to
Prof. J. Loserth, Mr. F. D. Matthew, Dr. R. L. Poole‚ Mr.
Bullock, etc. The Society's thanks are also due to the
Governing Bodies of Trinity and Queen's Colleges, Cam-
bridge3 Trinity Oollege, Dublin ; and the University Libraries
of Vienna and Prague, for loans of MSS. for the use of the
Society’s Editors.
